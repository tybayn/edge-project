          <p>Junior/Senior Year EDGE Project (SUU 2019): Photo and Voice Recognition software intended to be a very basic Artificial Intelligence with basic Machine Learning.</p>
          <p>The software is a Visual Studio Project written in C#. It utilizes a microphone and camera in order to learn people's faces and names. Once a person is added it will attempt to remember that individual the next time it sees them.</p>
          <p>This software is currently only designed for Windows systems, specifically Windows 10 with .NET.</p>

          <h3>Project Description</h3>
          <p>For this project I will design, create, and code an Artificial Intelligence (AI) written in C# (.NET framework). This artificial intelligence will be able to record a person's face and voice and remember them. Then at a later time be able to recall that data and be able to compare it to a live feed of a person's face and voice and compare the two sources to see if they match.</p>
          <p>This project encompasses ideas of self learning and the ability of a computer to recognize valid input apart from invalid input. To see the full project description, all the steps along the way, the final product, and my reflections about the project, see the sections below.</p>
          <h4>Abstract</h4>
          <p>For my EDGE project I will design, create, and code an Artificial Intelligence (AI) written in C#. This artificial intelligence will be able to record a person's face and voice and remember them. Then at a later time be able to recall that data and be able to compare it to a live feed of a person's face and voice and compare the two sources to see if they match. This AI will allow for the personal discovery of how data is represented and stored in a computer, how to compare audio and video as it is represented in a computer, and how AI’s can be used in different scenarios and for different purposes. I plan to build this AI to prove to myself that I have the ability to learn and push myself further than what is required and be able to use this as a standout point on my resume. This will also allow me to have an experience in programming something that is greatly needed in the work world, but not largely taught in universities.</p>
          <h4>Larger Purpose</h4>
          <p>I have chosen to build this project to give me experience in writing, coding, and creating an Artificial Intelligence. It will allow me to gain an understanding of how computers view live images and digital conversions of analog audio and how to compare them.</p>
          <h4>Project Goal</h4>
          <p>For my EDGE project I will create an Interactive Artificial Intelligence that will correctly identify and recognize faces and voice (video and audio). The AI will compare live audio feed from a microphone and live video feed from a webcam and compare it to stored audio and video files. The AI will be able to learn new people and recognize them later.</p>
          <h4>Outcomes</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>If I create an AI that can prompt for and record new people, then I will have a better understanding of machine learning and how computers “remember” data and how that data is represented in a computer.</li>
            <li>If I create an AI, then I begin to understand the usefulness and applications of different kinds of AI’s.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Deliverables</h4>
          <p>I will deliver a zip file that contains the actual AI software executable files alongside all the needed dependency files and “memory” files. I will also provide the paperwork with the design process and any subprograms used for testing functionality of parts of the software.</p>
          <h4>Differentiation</h4>
          <p>Artificial Intelligence is not a subject that is taught at SUU or many other universities. But the ideas of each of those topics are needed greatly. By creating an AI I will be able to have a deeper understanding of a topic that is largely expanding and companies of all types are starting to look toward to optimize and accelerate processes. With this project I will be able to include AI creation on my resume and have a starting ground when I need to create other AI’s in the future.</p>
          <h4>Estimated Timeline</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>05/06/2019</strong> - Begin Project</li>
            <li><strong>05/12/2019</strong> - Complete layout of software and flowcharting</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Started working on the ability to add new people and started to finalize the process for comparing people. Still researching FFT from wav and audio comparisons. Audio recordings are already implemented, but they are not being compared while testing.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><u>05/24/2019</u></p>
          <ul>
            <li>I started working on the audio comparisons. The FFT comparisons are still largely being developed and I don't want to put too much time into this project or do a PhD yet. So I will be using a different method to test audio. I am going to look into converting the wav files to strings using speech-to-text, and then comparing the strings</li>
          </ul>
          <p><u>05/26/2019</u></p>
          <ul>
            <li>I got the audio comparisons working, and small testing is showing that it is working. I got that part imported into the main program, the driver is also complete now. The comparison function now utilizes both the video and audio comparison functions. Commenting and inline documentation is done.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><u>05/27/2019</u></p>
          <ul>
            <li>I started doing testing with more people, the face recognition works surprisingly well, but the voice does not. It seems to have too much background static for the Speech-to-Text to work.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><u>05/29/2019</u></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Doing some research on how to fix the Speech-to-Text issue, will try changing the recording data from 8-bit to 16-bit and from stereo to mono.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><u>06/02/2019</u></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Doing some final testing. Checking if the new settings to the microphone will be helping. - The settings do help, but we needed to create new audio files where the pitch is shifted down, that way people with higher voices can be recognized as well. After this change, the testing went smoothly. The AI was able to correctly identify people about 90% of the time. Given there are only 2 of us that are testing.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><u>06/02/2019</u></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Testing is complete. Got files ready for Turn In. Made video to showcase project.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>This was one of my first big projects that I did by myself with no guidance or requirements. It allowed my to branch out and to figure out what I know, what I was able to learn, and what I still need to work on. In the end, I am proud of the results and the software created.</p>
          <p>I have found that this maybe truly isn't an AI, but more a machine learning in its most basic definition. I still have a lot to learn, but I found this project to be enjoyable.</p>
